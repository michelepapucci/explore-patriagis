Mages are accomplished spellcasters whose lives have been shaped by magic. They can use their powers to defend or dominate other creatures, or they could focus on magical research and unlocking mystical secrets.

## Mages

*Magical Scholars and Spellcasters*

Mages are magical wonder-workers, ranging from spellcasting overlords to reclusive witches. They study mystical secrets and possess insight into monsters, legends, omens, and other lore. Mages often gather allies or hire assistants to aid them in their research or to attain magical might.

Roll on or choose a result from the Mage Roles table to inspire different sorts of mages.
