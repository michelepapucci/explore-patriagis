## Deva

*World-Changing Angelic Messenger*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Upper Planes)  
- **Treasure.** Relics  

Devas are emissaries of divine will. These immortal messengers adopt the shapes of mystical beasts or idealized, winged mortals. As with all angels, their true forms are known only to the gods they serve.

Rather than literal correspondence from a god, a deva conveys an allegory or quest to mortals, tasking them with delivering something to its rightful place. While the angel might be called on in times of need, it encourages mortal heroism. Should a deva's chosen champions carry out their charge, they experience a revelation or the world is changed in line with divine purpose. Roll on or choose a result from the Deva Messages table to inspire a deva's charge.

**Deva Messages**
