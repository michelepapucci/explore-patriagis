# [Vine Blight](compendium/bestiary/plant/vine-blight-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 44*  

Vine blights resemble humans wrapped in vines common to the areas in which they grow, from hairy ivy vines to flowering kudzu. They can cause plants to burst from the ground around themselves and entangle nearby foes.

Unlike most other blights, vine blights can speak. They do so rarely, typically only to convey messages from their masters or to repeat the words of their victims in rasping voices.

## Blights

*Plants Sprouted from Evil*

- **Habitat.** Forest  
- **Treasure.** None  

Blights are malicious plants that sprout from deep-rooted evil. Their gnarled forms twist with fearsome features suggestive of human limbs and vicious maws. Blights lurk in ambush amid mundane vegetation and lash out at non-Plant creatures. While blights can act independently, they're usually motivated by whatever sinister forces spawned them or by wicked creatures with control over nature. The magic that creates blights often affects other vegetation as well, causing brambles, vines, and gnarled trees to overwhelm roads and fields, choke wells and streams, and force animals from their natural habitat. This might make blights the first sign of an oncoming wave of corruption.
