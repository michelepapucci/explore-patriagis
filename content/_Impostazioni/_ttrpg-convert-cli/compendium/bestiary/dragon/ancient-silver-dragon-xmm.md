# [Ancient Silver Dragon](compendium/bestiary/dragon/ancient-silver-dragon-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 280*  

Ancient silver dragons pursue world-wide change. They defend their communities and allies, encouraging them to perform deeds worthy of legend. Some set their sights on other worlds and planes of existence, creating extraplanar alliances or combating multiplanar threats. They might have guises in multiple societies and forge generation-spanning friendships with heroic families or valorous groups.

## Silver Dragons

*Dragons of Courage and Fairness*

- **Habitat.** Mountain, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Arcana  

Silver dragons work to preserve peace and encourage greatness. They try to live as examples of decency while remaining watchful against evil.

Silver dragons typically dwell amid snow-capped mountains, though aspirations and congeniality drive some to instead live among cosmopolitan societies. Disguised as humanoids, they ally with artists, historians, knights, and humble leaders who learn from the past to create better futures.

Silver dragons take inspiration from legendary heroes and have grand ambitions. Many collect treasures that reflect these interests, such as histories, ancient art, and the gear of famous champions.

### Silver Dragon Lairs

Silver dragons typically lair in picturesque mountain retreats or on sculpted cloud "islands."
