# [Death Knight Aspirant](compendium/bestiary/undead/death-knight-aspirant-xmm.md)
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 93*  

When the leader of a villainous order rises as a death knight, their wicked devotees might join them in their cursed existence as death knight aspirants. These followers bear a measure of their leader's power and serve as they did in life, obediently following the death knight's decrees and heralding its terrible will.

## Death Knights

*Haunted Commanders of Unliving Legions*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Armaments  

Champions of evil, death knights are armor-clad, skeletal warlords. Combining devastating martial prowess and blasphemous magic, these undying tyrants lead unholy legions against the living or brood in cursed citadels. Every death knight is haunted by a legacy of tragedy and dishonor that drives it to commit greater evils.
